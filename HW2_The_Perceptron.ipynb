        "Write a couple paragraphs interpreting the results with all the combinations of hyperparameters. Drawing a plot will probably help you make a point. In particular, answer the following:\n",
        "- A. Do you need to train with all the training dataset to get the highest accuracy with the test dataset?\n",
        "- B. How do you justify that training the second run obtains worse accuracy than the first one (despite the second one uses more training data)?\n",

        "```\n",
        "- C. Can you get higher accuracy with additional hyperparameters (higher than `80.0`)?\n",

        "A. No, it is not required to train with the whole training dataset in order to get the best accuracy on the test dataset. The findings suggest that employing only a portion of the training dataset can result in excellent accuracy on the test dataset. For example, with a learning rate of 0.01 and 100 epochs, training with only 25% of the training dataset (tr: 100) results in an accuracy of 80.0%, which is comparable to or even higher than the accuracy achieved with larger training dataset sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "B. Several causes can explain the decline in accuracy despite using more training data in the second run than in the first. One explanation is that the additional training data introduced more noise or outliers, lowering the model's generalization ability. Another factor could be the specific distribution of data points in the additional training data, resulting in a less representative training set that reduces the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "C. While the results produced using the provided hyperparameters do not exceed 80.0% accuracy, more accuracy can be achieved by adding more hyperparameters or tweaking current ones. For example, investigating more complicated optimization strategies, feature engineering, or employing more complex models may result in increased accuracy. Experimenting with a broader set of hyperparameters, such as different learning rates, epochs, and maybe other parameters, may also help to improve accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "D. It is not always worthwhile to train for more epochs, especially if it results in decreasing returns in terms of accuracy improvement or considerably raises processing expenses. The findings indicate that increasing the number of epochs does not always result in improved accuracy, as indicated by several hyperparameter combinations where accuracy remains relatively constant or even falls with additional epochs. When determining how many epochs to train the model, it is critical to strike a balance between processing resources and required accuracy."
